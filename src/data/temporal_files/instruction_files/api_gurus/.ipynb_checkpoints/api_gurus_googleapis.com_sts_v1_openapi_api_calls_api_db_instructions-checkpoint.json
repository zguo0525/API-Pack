When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API.

When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Exchanges a credential that represents the resource owner's authorization for a Google-generated [OAuth 2.0 access token] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5) or [refreshes an accesstoken] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-6) following [the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8693) The credential can be one of the following: - An authorization code issued by the workforce identity federation authorization endpoint - A [refresh token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-10.4) issued by this endpoint This endpoint is only meant to be called by the Google Cloud CLI.
