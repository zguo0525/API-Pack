# API Pack A Massive Multi-Programming Language Dataset for API Call Generation

This is the repository for [API Pack A Massive Multi-Programming Language Dataset for API Call Generation](https://github.com/zguo0525/API-Pack)

## Overview

API Pack is rooted in the goal of improving the interaction between large language models and various programming interfaces. By providing a vast collection of instruction-API call pairs, API Pack facilitates a more nuanced understanding and generation of API calls, a critical aspect of programming and software development.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Dataset:** Over one million instruction-API call pairs, catering to a wide range of API call generation scenarios.
- **Multilingual Support:** Designed to advance cross-lingual API call generation capabilities without the need for extensive language-specific data.
- **Proven Efficacy:** Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning models with API Pack significantly enhances their performance in generating unseen API calls. Fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on just 20,000 Python instances results in over 10% and 5% higher accuracy compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively.
- **Improved Generalization:** Scaling the training process to 100,000 examples further boosts the models' ability to generalize to new APIs not encountered during training.
